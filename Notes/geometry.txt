Contains some geometry stuff and tricks

1. Sometimes geometry preprocessing / counting can be done using bitsets as well as it will reduce time complexity by 32

2. Cross product : right hand thumb rule

    + ve : anti clockwise
    - ve : clockwise

3. Finding no of special points inside convex polygon 

    ** : one method is to find all left points of those edges using bitset and AND them
    ** : another method is the triangle area method (Link : https://discuss.codechef.com/t/chefpoly-editorial/12230)
