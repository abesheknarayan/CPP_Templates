Contains some tricks for combinatorics


1. Catalan number applications: 
    
    == Number of balanced bracket sequence

2. For finding x1+x2+ ...  + xn = sum where   1<=xi<= (some x)
   we can use dp , like counting triangle method 
   
   for x+y = sum it would be  dp[i+x]-- and dp[i+1]++; and after doing prefix sum 
   similarly we can extrapolate for bigger equations


3. simplifying bigger powers using a^(phi(p)-1) == 1 mod p , find just the remainder

4. Fibonacci number:
   4.1 No of ways of partitioning n into odd numbers [1,1,2,3,5,...]
