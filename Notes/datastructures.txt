Contains stuff related to data structures


1. HLD orz what a technique

   in HLD actually for problems related to edges its better to use lca and find somethings --> TODO or try to do in pashka style 
   in problems with nodes values we can use our HLD template

   Some nice HLD implementation problems

      https://www.spoj.com/problems/ADAVISIT/ --> stupid SPOJ problems always strict limits but nice idea
      


2. [HLD vs CD]:
       
        When given 2 nodes in a tree as query (function maybe something associatve) and some changes happen in the tree like modifying value of node , hld is used.
        
        Centroid Decomposition is used when you are given a node and a parameter (like distance or something) and to find function of all nodes satifying
        the given condition
