Contains some standard dp tricks

1-D dp tricks are mostly trivial


1. dp[x][y] --> saw first x places and filled y of them

   mostly dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j-1] + something, dp[i-1][j]);

2. dp[l][r] --> sub array dp 

   mostly dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j] + something, dp[i][j-1]);
                      
                            or
          dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j-1] + something); --> cases where you worry about two endpoints of the subarray

3. In some game stuff,

   We can write lambda function and use memoization
